# Introducing version control with Git

Move beyond ‘undo’, renaming and email. Keep a history of your changes to documents, images, files and code. Git version control lets you compare, recover or reuse content from earlier versions of your documents and data. At the same time it supports collaboration through attribution and advanced merging of different versions, facilitating team-work on complex documents. This workshop introduces you to git version control for your research.
